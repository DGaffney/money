                <p>This tool helps you determine the breakeven point for when a property investment's equity has built up so much that the proportional returns have decreased compared to having the same amount of money invested in an index fund. Input key parameters such as property cost, down payment, mortgage terms, and more to see detailed charts and tables of your potential returns.</p>
